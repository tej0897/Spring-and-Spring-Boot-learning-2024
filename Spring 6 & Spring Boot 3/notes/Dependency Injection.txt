Dependency Injection:

Dependency: An object usually requires "objects from other class" to perform some operations. These are called objects dependencies
    Example: Traveler class objects are dependent on bike/car/cycle class' objects.

        ******

Injection: The process of providing the required dependencies to an object.
    Example: Injecting car/bike/cycle to traveler object.

_____________________________________________

The dependency is injected by framework, so it is also called as IOC (inversion of control)

Reduces the coupling between multiple objects as it is dynamically injected by the framework.

Difference between Spring IOC and Dependency Injection

Spring IOC creates Spring Beans and manages it's life-cycle. IOC uses DI to inject one object into another object.

Dependency Injection: just provides the necessary dependent objects.

Dependency Injection Types:

    1. Constructor based 
    2. Setter based
    3. Field based


        ******

1. Constructor Based:
    
    uses constructor to inject dependency on any spring-managed bean. 

    If the class has only one constructor, we need not add @Autowired annotation. It is Optional. (above 4.3 versions of Spring)

    If there are multiple constructors, we will have to add @Autowired to any one of those constructors for spring to know which one to use to inject dependencies. 

        ******

2. Setter Based:
    
        Uses Setter method to inject dependency on any spring-managed bean. 

        instead of constructor, we use setter method. Rest remains the same.

3. Field Based:
